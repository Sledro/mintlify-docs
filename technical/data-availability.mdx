title: "2. Data Availability"
---

> Data availability (DA) refers to a user's confidence that the data required to verify a block is available to all network participants.

In the context of layer two rollups, data availability is a critical component. It ensures that all network participants can verify the state of the layer two chain.
All of the data required to verify the correctness of the off chain execution must be available to all network participant for the duration of the blocks challenge period.
If the data is not avaible to all network participants, validators can not verify the off chain execution and funds could be stolen.

Early layer two scaling solutions achieved data availability by compressing and storing the transaction data on their layer one network, such as Ethereum. This is the obvious solution.
However, it has some drawbacks:

1. **Cost:** It is very expensive to store data on Ethereum. This cost is usually borne by the end user of the layer two protocol and increases the overall transaction fee.

2. **Congestion:** Submitting batches of transactions directly to Ethereum can result in unnecessary network congestion, resulting in higher fees.

## LightLink Data Availability

LightLink is one of the first layer two protocols to leverage Celestia's novel data availability protocol. Celestia is a modular data availability network enabling consensus around whether
a piece of data is available. Celestia Blobstream is the first data availability solution for Ethereum that securely scales with the number of users. Blobstream relays commitments to
Celestia's data root to an on-chain light client on Ethereum for integration by developers into L2 contracts. This enables Ethereum developers to build high-throughput L2s using Celestia's
optimised DA layer, the first with Data Availability Sampling (DAS). LightLink was designed to work with Celestia from the ground up, enabling cost-effective data availability and therefore,
cheaper fees for LightLink users.

Every rollup header that is submitted to Ethereum by LightLink contains a `pointer` to where that data is stored on the Celestia network. This pointer is a commitment to the data availability.

```solidity
/// @notice A pointer to a shares on Celestia.
/// @param height - The height of the block on Celestia.
/// @param shareStart - The start index of shares in block on Celestia.
/// @param shareLen - The length of the shares in block on Celestia.
struct CelestiaPointer {
    uint64 height;
    uint24 shareStart;
    uint16 shareLen;
}
```

Layer 2 blocks are uploaded to Celestia as shares, Celestia validators attests to the availability of a binary Merkle root which contains these shares. Theses attestations can be verified on Ethereum using
the Blobstream contracts. If a Celestia validator withholds data or produces incorrect blocks it can be detected by anyone running a light node and be slashed.

<Note>
  Potential fallback challenges considered – in the unlikely event of extreme
  collusion of Celestia validators.
</Note>

LightLink provides a ChainOracle contract on layer 1 which allows the cost effective loading of layer 2 headers and transactions from Celestia shares. All items loaded through the ChainOracle
are proven to correspond to the Celestia pointer inside a submitted rollup block. The proofs also include the Binary Merkle proof showing the shares are part of an attested celestia data root committed
to the blobstream.

Any user can challenge the data availability of a rollup header by submitting a challenge to the Challenge contract by calling the `challengeDataRootInclusion` function. Once a challenge is submitted,
a defender will be required to respond by submitting a proof that the data is available. If the defender fails to respond, the challenger will be able to claim the reward.

The code below shows how the data availability is verified via Blobstream verifier within the Challenge contract.

```solidity
// verify the provided proof is valid – this also calls verifyAttestations.
(bool success, ) = DAVerifier.verifySharesToDataRootTupleRoot(
    daOracle,
    _proof,
    _proof.attestationProof.tuple.dataRoot
);
require(success, "failed to verify shares to data root tuple root");
```
