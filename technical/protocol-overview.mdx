<Note>
  This documentation is intended for technical users and developers who are interested in
  understanding the LightLink protocol and how it works.

<Warning>
  Although LightLink has a live mainnet, the protocol is still in active development and in Beta. As
  such, the information provided in this documentation is subject to change.

LightLink is an
<Tooltip tip="Optimiums scale blockchains by moving execution and data availability off the base layer">Optimium</Tooltip>
Rollup protocol that scales [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) by moving execution to a new layer
(layer 2), aggregating transactions into batches and posting these batches on both layer one
Ethereum and data availability layer [Celestia](https://celestia.org/). This modular design allows
LightLink to leverage the security of Ethereum while achieving high throughput and low transaction
fees.

Our novel layer two design comprises of several interconnected components, each playing a crucial
role within the ecosystem. LightLink harnesses the Ethereum platform as its settlement layer,
housing the CanonicalStateChain. Operating at the execution layer is our custom client, heavily
inspired by the renowned open-source Ethereum client
[Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). LightLink builds upon the remarkable advancements
achieved by the Celestia team to provide secure, modular data availability.

When transactions are submitted to the LightLink network, they are processed by the sequencer node,
which orders and validates them before adding them to a new layer two block. A publisher
periodically consolidates multiple layer two blocks into a single bundle, which is then used to
create a new roll-up block header on layer one. The entire L2 block and transaction data is
compressed and posted to Celestia, which provides consensus around whether the data is available to
be downloaded by any network participant for verification.

Each header contains a reference to every transaction in the bundle, allowing users to verify the
state of the layer two chain by checking the CanonicalStateChain contract.

The pivotal role of consolidating multiple layer two blocks into a singular bundle rests with the
Hummingbird Node running in publisher mode. Subsequently, this bundle serves as the foundation for
crafting a new roll-up block headers on layer one. The publisher's duties extend to posting bundle
data to Celestia, while concurrently issuing new block headers to the Canonical State Chain contract
with each bundle iteration. Lastly, the Hummingbird Smart Contracts serve as the linchpin,
orchestrating seamless integration within the system.
