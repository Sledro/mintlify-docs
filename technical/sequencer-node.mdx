title: "3. Sequencer Node"
---

Initially, the sequencer node is hosted and maintained by the LightLink team. In the future, it is possible for the sequencer node to be randomly distributed amongst peers with some form of staking and slashing mechanism to enforce honesty.

The sequencer node assumes the pivotal role of constructing layer two blocks within the system. Tasked with receiving and validating transactions from replicator nodes, it proceeds to order and process them accordingly. Upon successfully processing a transaction and embedding it within a layer two block, the state of the layer two chain progresses accordingly. Subsequently, the newly formed L2Block is disseminated across all peers within the layer two network.

Transactions are prioritised for inclusion in the next L2Block based on their gas price, with those offering the highest gas price given precedence. Furthermore, the sequencing of transactions within the block is determined by their nonce and gas price.

Presently, the sequencer produces a new L2Block every 500 milliseconds, with these blocks cryptographically appended to the layer two chain. This 500ms production rate is deemed reasonable; however, it remains adjustable to suit evolving requirements. The sequencer diligently populates each new L2Block until it reaches the predetermined gas limit, presently set at 15,000,000 gwei. Plans are underway to significantly elevate this block gas limit as the network matures, thereby enhancing the protocol's theoretical throughput from 1428 transactions per second (TPS) to over 10,000.

Transactions committed to L2Blocks attain a level of "soft finality", signifying their status as final as long as the sequencer operates with integrity. The veracity of transactions processed by the sequencer undergoes independent validation by community validators, ensuring the sequencers continued honesty and integrity.

In the event of sequencer downtime, seamless continuity is assured through the deployment of a new sequencer. The chain persists, with the new sequencer inheriting the chain's history from existing replicators and seamlessly assuming the task of block production. The LightLink DAO is responsible for updating the sequencer.
