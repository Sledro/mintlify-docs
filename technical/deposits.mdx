title: '7. Deposits'

A deposit transaction is a special type of transaction that is initiated on L1 and executed on L2.
Deposits are fully permissionless and must be included by the sequencer. LightLink's deposit system
leverages the great open source work done by the team at Optimism.

## L1 Processing

1. An L1 entity, either a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA), sends a deposit
   transaction to L1CrossDomainMessenger, using sendMessage. This function accepts three parameters:

   - `target`, target address on L2.
   - `message`, the L2 transaction's calldata, formatted as per the ABI of the target account.
   - `minGasLimit`, the minimum gas limit allowed for the transaction on L2. Note that this is a
     minimum and the actual amount provided on L2 may be higher (but never lower) than the specified
     gas limit. The actual amount provided on L2 is often higher because the portal contract on L2
     performs some processing before submitting the call to `target`.

2. The L1 cross domain messenger calls its own `send` function. It uses these parameters:

   - `to`, the destination address, is the messenger on the other side. In the case of deposits,
     this is always `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007`.
   - `gasLimit`, the gas limit. This value is calculated using the baseGas function.
   - `value`, the ETH that is sent with the message. This amount is taken from the transaction
     value.
   - `data`, the calldata for the call on L2 that is needed to relay the message. This is an ABI
     encoded call to relayMessage.
   - `sendMessage` calls the portal's depositTransaction function.

<Note>
  the other contracts can also call depositTransaction directly. However, doing so bypasses certain
  safeguards, so in most cases it's a bad idea.

3. The depositTransaction function runs a few sanity checks, and then emits a `TransactionDeposited`
   event.

## L2 Processing

1. The `op-node` component looks for `TransactionDeposited` events on L1. If it sees any such
   events, it parses them.

2. Next, `op-node` converts those `TransactionDeposited` events into deposit transactions.

3. In most cases, user deposit transactions call the `relayMessage` function of
   L2CrossDomainMessenger.

4. `relayMessage` runs a few sanity checks and then, if everything is good, calls the real target
   contract with the relayed calldata.
