LightLink's mission is to seamlessly integrate millions into the digital economy through user-focused dApps and enterprise partnerships, making blockchain as intuitive and accessible as Web2, without the complexity of gas fees and protocols.

We anticipate that most users are unfamiliar with the mechanics of gas fees or the cost of 1 gwei in USD, just as they donâ€™t concern themselves with TCP or IPv4/IPv6 protocols while using Web2. Our goal is to offer them all the on-chain benefits, such as permissionless access and a digital economy, without the blockchain complexities that early enthusiasts have become familiar with.
