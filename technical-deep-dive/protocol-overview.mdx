Our novel layer two design comprises several interconnected components, each playing a crucial role within the ecosystem. LightLink harnesses the Ethereum platform as its settlement layer, housing the Canonical State Chain. Operating at the execution layer is our custom client, heavily inspired by the renowned open-source Ethereum client Geth. LightLink builds upon the remarkable advancements achieved by the Celestia team to provide secure, modular data availability.

The architecture diagram above, illustrates the comprehensive data flow within the protocol. For most users, interaction primarily revolves around light clients or replicator nodes. These key components facilitate seamless submission of new transactions and enable direct querying of the layer two blockchain through their JSON-RPC APIs. Transactions submitted to a replicator node or light client undergo eventual ordering by the sequencer, culminating in their inclusion within a block.

The pivotal role of consolidating multiple layer two blocks into a singular bundle rests with the Hummingbird Node running in publisher mode. Subsequently, this bundle serves as the foundation for crafting a new roll-up block headers on layer one. The publisher's duties extend to posting bundle data to Celestia, while concurrently issuing new block headers to the Canonical State Chain contract with each bundle iteration. Lastly, the Hummingbird Smart Contracts serve as the linchpin, orchestrating seamless integration within the system.
