To start using LightLink, you must first connect your Web3 wallet to our network.

<Tip>
  LightLink is supported by most EVM wallets, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) and [Trust
  Wallet](https://trustwallet.com).
</Tip>

We recommend MetaMask as it is one of the oldest and well trusted web3 wallets. MetaMask can be used
directly in your web browser as a browser extension/add-on or via their official mobile app. You can
use MetaMask to interact with the LightLink network, create your wallet, view your wallet balance
and send transactions. The full list of MetaMask features can be found on the official
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io) website.

Once installed, please find guidelines on how to connect your MetaMask wallet below.
