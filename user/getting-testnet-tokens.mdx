title: "Getting Tesetnet Tokens"
---

Testnets are separate networks designed for learning, experimenting, and testing. The network parameters of testnets are the same as those in mainnets, except that the testnet gas tokens (ETH) are free and carry no real-world value.

Although testnet tokens are free, they must be minted within the protocol's rules. Many EVM protocols cannot simply distribute millions of testnet ETH to everyone, as they cannot mint them arbitrarily.

<Tip>
  Remember, you can claim 0.01 ETH once every 12 hours. With LightLink's low
  fees, this amount should be sufficient for most projects. If you require more
  for extensive tests or high-frequency dApps, please contact the LightLink team
  on Discord, and we will assist you.
