title: "Building on LightLink"
---

From a developers perspective, building on LightLink is similar to building on Ethereum. LightLink is fully compatible with Ethereum's EVM, so you can use the same tools, libraries, and languages you're already familiar with.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the LightLink SDK. You can find the installation instructions in the [LightLink SDK documentation](https://docs.lightlink.io/sdk).
