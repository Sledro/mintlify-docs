# Standard Bridge

LightLinks provides a fully permissionless standard bridge to move assets between Ethereum and
LightLink. The bridge supports the transfer of ETH and and ERC20 tokens.

The standard bridge is has a graphical user interface build and maintained by the LightLink team
that can be accessed at [bridge.lightlinks.io](https://bridge.lightlinks.io).

This document is a guide for developers who want to integrate the LightLink bridge into their own
applications.

For more information on the LightLink bridge, please refer to the
[technical documentation](https://docs.lightlinks.io/technical/bridge).

### LightLink SDK

The LightLink SDK is a Typescript library that provides a set of functions to interact with the
standard bridge. The `ll-sdk` is available as an NPM package and can be installed using the
following command:

```bash
npm install @lightlinks/sdk
```

The SDK can be configured with the following options:

```typescript
import {
  CrossChainMessenger,
  L1ChainID,
  L2ChainID,
  MessageStatus,
} from '@lightlink-network/ll-sdk';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const l1Provider = new ethers.providers.StaticJsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC_URL!);
const l2Provider = new ethers.providers.StaticJsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC_URL!);
const l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, l1Provider);
const l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, l2Provider);

const messenger = new CrossChainMessenger({
  l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet,
  l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet,
  l1ChainId: L1ChainID.SEPOLIA, // OR MAINNET
  l2ChainId: L2ChainID.LIGHTLINK_PEGASUS, // OR LIGHTLINK_PHOENIX
  lightlink: true,
});
```

### Deposit ETH

To deposit ETH from Ethereum to LightLink, we can use the `depositETH` function.

The deposited will be relayed to LightLink automatically after 12 confirmations on Ethereum.

```typescript
// Deposit 0.001 ETH to L2 via the L1 standard bridge
let tx = await messenger.depositETH(ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001'));
await tx.wait();

// The sequencer will relay the deposit to L2 after 12  L1 confirmations
await messenger.waitForMessageStatus(tx.hash, MessageStatus.RELAYED);
```

### Withdraw ETH

To withdraw ETH from LightLink to Ethereum, we need to perform a few steps:

1. Call the `withdrawETH` function to initiate the withdrawal on LightLink.
2. Wait for the withdrawal to be ready to prove.
3. Call the `proveWithdrawal` function to prove the withdrawal on Ethereum.
4. Wait for 7 days for the withdrawal to be finalized on Ethereum.
5. Cal the `finalizeWithdrawal` function to finalize the withdrawal on Ethereum.

```typescript
// Withdraw 0.001 ETH from L2 to L1 via the L1 standard bridge
let tx = await messenger.withdrawETH(ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001"));
await tx.wait();

// The withdrawal will be rolled up and submitted to the Canonical State Chain on L1.
// It can take up to 6-12 hours for the withdrawal to become ready to prove.
await messenger.waitForMessageStatus(tx.hash, MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE);

// Prove the withdrawal on L1
let tx = await messenger.proveMessage(txHash);
await tx.wait();

// We must wait 7 days for the withdrawal to be finalized on L1

// Finalize the withdrawal on L1
let tx = await messenger.finalizeMessage(tx.hash);
await tx.wait();
```

### Deposit ERC20

To deposit ERC20 tokens we simply need to approve the L1 standard bridge to spend the tokens and
then call the `depositERC20` function.

```typescript
// Approve the L1 standard bridge to spend 0.001 ERC20
let tx = await messenger.approveERC20(l1Token, l2Token, oneToken.toString());
await tx.wait();

// Deposit 1 ERC20 to L2 via the L1 standard bridge
let tx = await messenger.depositERC20(
  l1TokenAddress,
  l2TokenAddress,
  ethers.utils.parseEther("1")
);
await tx.wait();

// The sequencer will automatically relay the deposit to L2 after 12 L1 confirmations
await messenger.waitForMessageStatus(tx2.hash, MessageStatus.RELAYED);
```

### Withdraw ERC20

To withdraw ERC20 tokens from LightLink to Ethereum, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Call the `withdrawERC20` function to initiate the withdrawal on LightLink.
2. Wait for the withdrawal to be ready to prove.
3. Call the `proveWithdrawal` function to prove the withdrawal on Ethereum.
4. Wait for 7 days for the withdrawal to be finalized on Ethereum.
5. Call the `finalizeWithdrawal` function to finalize the withdrawal on Ethereum.

```typescript
// Withdraw 1 ERC20 from L2 to L1 via the L1 standard bridge
let tx2 = await messenger.withdrawERC20(
  l1TokenAddress,
  l2TokenAddress,
  ethers.utils.parseEther("1")
);
await tx2.wait();

// The withdrawal will rolled up and submitted to the Canonical State Chain.
// It can take up to 6-12 hours for the withdrawal to become ready to prove.
await messenger.waitForMessageStatus(tx2.hash, MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE);

// Prove the withdrawal on L1
let tx = await messenger.proveMessage(tx2.hash);
await tx.wait();

// We must wait 7 days for the withdrawal to be finalized on L1

// Finalize the withdrawal on L1
let tx = await messenger.finalizeMessage(tx.hash);
await tx.wait();
```
