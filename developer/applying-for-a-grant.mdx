## Grant Program

The LightLink Grant Program is designed to support developers and projects that are building on
LightLink. We are looking for projects that are innovative, useful, and have a positive impact on
the LightLink ecosystem.

### How to apply

To apply for a grant, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a proposal**: Write a proposal that outlines your project, the problem you are solving,
   and how you plan to use the grant funds.

2. **Submit your proposal**: Submit your proposal by filling out the [grant
   application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf

### Selection process

The LightLink team will review all grant applications and select projects based on the following
criteria:

- **Innovation**: How innovative is the project? Does it solve a real problem?
- **Impact**: What impact will the project have on the LightLink ecosystem?
- **Feasibility**: Is the project feasible? Can it be completed within the proposed timeline?
- **Team**: Does the team have the skills and experience to execute the project?

### Grant terms

If your project is selected for a grant, you will be required to sign a grant agreement that
outlines the terms and conditions of the grant. The grant agreement will include details such as the
grant amount, the project timeline, and any other requirements.
