[LightLink](https://lightlink.io) is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain with a [novel rollup design](technical-deep-dive), that enables dApps and enterprises offer users instant, gasless transactions.

Since 2017, we've been developing blockchain solutions for major enterprises in the APAC region. Recognizing the need for broader interoperability, we shifted our focus to building L2, aiming to bridge dApps with millions of users from our enterprise partners and foster an interconnected economy.

As the first L2 to leverage Optimum architecture with a proprietary stack, LightLink aims to support 10,000+ TPS at under $0.01, without gas spikes.

LightLink's novel [Enterprise Mode](https://c/io) enables businesses to operate gas-free, allowing users on their platforms to engage in a secure, user-friendly blockchain network without transaction fees, barriers to entry, or the need for any tokens.

LightLink already powers over 30 partnerships, including Animoca Brands, and is being integrated in Translucia, a US$300 million venture by T&B Media Global.

With LightLink in its early stages, we offer developers a less saturated liquidity space and the unique opportunity to scale dApps in a zero gas fee environment, while maintaining connectivity with the vast Ethereum ecosystem for broader reach and integration.
