Gas fees are a significant hurdle for user onboarding. It is confusing to explain to newcomers why they need to buy ETH or TRX to use USDT, why transaction fees fluctuate, and why fees might exceed the transaction value.

LightLink's Enterprise Mode offers a solution for dApps and enterprises to provide their users with gasless transactions (zero fees), thereby simplifying onboarding.

dApps and enterprises pay a fixed price in stablecoins for a set amount of gas units and register smart contracts to utilize that gas. Their users send transactions with the gasPrice parameter set to 0, enabling on-chain operations without needing any tokens in their balances.
