LightLink is a fully EVM-equivalent chain with [Celestia underneath](https://celestia.org/). Our
proprietary stack and industry-leading infrastructure offer full on-chain advantages, allowing users
to experience blockchain's network effects without the technical complexity.

LightLink is the first L2 leveraging Optimum architecture with its proprietary stack, which
separates the consensus, execution, and data availability layers. This enables it to reach 10,000+
TPS at under $0.01, without gas spikes.

LightLink isn't a fork. Instead, it is built on a [proprietary stack](./technical) and utilizes
Ethereum Optimistic Rollups along with a battle-tested Geth (go-ethereum) client.

Solidity is the most popular smart contract programming language in the world. We donâ€™t want to
reinvent the wheel, so we are utilizing it and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

LightLink employs the [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) codebase to achieve full
compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers can write their smart contracts in
Visual Studio Code, test them with standard toolchains like Ganache, deploy them using Hardhat, and
interact with LightLink using other familiar tools.

It all allows developers to migrate and scale their dApps on LightLink without the need to rewrite
their code.
